Please note that this code assumes you have already set up the necessary libraries and hardware for wireless communication on your Arduino board. It utilizes the AES encryption library for performing encryption and decryption operations. You may need to install the AES library separately if it's not included in your Arduino IDE by default.

Remember that this is a basic example and may not cover all aspects of security. In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider additional security measures such as key management, authentication, integrity checks, and secure communication protocols.
